Bachelor's thesis. Spring 2018 OsloMet Electronic engineering

ABSTRACT:

This Bachelorâ€™s thesis has been a part of an ongoing research collaboration focusing on autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. The main objective of the project wasto design a drone that can be used as a platform for developing an autonomous swarm of drones at a later stage. 

The project specifications consisted of a drone equipped with necessary components for conducting manual flight, an onboard companion computer, an optical flow camera and a forward facing camera. The weight of the drone was specified to be no more than 250 grams, the minimum flight time requirement was set to 5 minutes and the thrust to weight ratio requirement was set to a minimum of 1.7. 

Some of the goals of the project were reached, and some were not. However, aconclusion of the project is that developing functional lightweight autonomous drones is realistic, given some more time and effort.
